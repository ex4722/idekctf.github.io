Formed in June of 2021, "idek" is an information security CTF team based primarily in the US with a few international players. The team is composed of a diverse mix of talented highschool and university students, along with a few select industry professionals. idek is not associated with an academic institution, but rather, is run independently by students from various highschools and universities. We've had numerous top-10 finishes, with a highest ranking of 6th in the US out of 3,800 teams, and 44th overall world-wide out of 28,000 teams. idek also has a junior team, mainly geared towards highschoolers and college students interested in learning more about CTF competitions, to promote both cybersecurity education and skill development.
